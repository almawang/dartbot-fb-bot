# DartBot-Tour Guide

API for DartBot - The Virtual Tour Guide Bot
DartBot (Tour Guide) provides prospective students with a tour of Dartmouth by (1) providing information about various locations across campus and directions to the next stop of the tour and (2) answering questions they may have using a Facebook Messenger ChatBot.

This repo contains the code for the Facebook Messenger Bot portion of the project.

## Architecture

Our code is organized into three main repos: the API backend, the DartBot Tour Guide frontend and the Facebook Messenger bot using botkit.
This repo stores JavaScript for our Facebook Messenger bot created using botkit.


## Setup
